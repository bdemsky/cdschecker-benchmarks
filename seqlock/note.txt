Inference results for this benchmark are consistent with the manual analysis.
In the write() function, either the load of _seq at the very beginning or the CAS
of the _seq when it succeeds must be acquire such that it establishes
synchronization between two contiguous write(). If not, the two _data.store
operations are not ordered by hb, and the next read() can read either, thus
allowing reading the wrong (old) value.
