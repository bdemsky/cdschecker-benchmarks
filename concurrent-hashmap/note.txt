#Non-SC:
The following case can be non-SC.

Thrd1						Thrd2
put(k1, v1); // a			put(k2, v2); // c
get(k2); // b				get(k1); // d

When b and d both read the old head of the list (and they later grab the lock,
making it the interface SC), it's non-SC because neither reads the updated
value.

Run testcase1 to make the store and load of value slot to be seq_cst.

Then run testcase2 with "-o annotation" to get store and load of key slot to be
release/acquire.

0m0.015s + 0m0.000 = 0m0.015s
