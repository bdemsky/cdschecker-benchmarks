We first ran dekker-fences-wildcard1 to get result1.txt, then we we run
dekker-fences-wildcard2 to get get result2.txt. In result2.txt, those results
that do not impose ordering to fences should be dropped, so we got the correct
result.

time ./run.sh benchmarks/dekker-fences/dekker-fences-wildcard1 -m2 -y -u3 -tSCFENCE -o weaken &> /scratch/a

We got result1.txt, and it took 1m20.790s.
